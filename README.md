# UFOs

## Overview

The overview of this module is to create a table to organize UFO data that is stored as a JavaScript array, or list. This table will have the ability to filter data based on certain criteria and will be created using JavaScript as the primary coding language.

## Results

As said in the challenge module the UFO sightings are filtered on multiple crieria. The website has the navigation bar and title with the picture at the top.

As we scroll down we see the data and filters. We have 5 different filters date, city, state, country and shape. You can choose any of these filters and enter the search bar, so that the HTML page will show all of the sightings for that specific search. We can use one filter or multiple filters at the same time. Below we have images of fitered data using different filters.

## Summary

  - Drawback
  The drawback I see in filtering is there is a lot of possibility to enter invalid data which are not found in our data file.
  
  - Two recommendations
    - My first recommendation would be to add dropdown menu to all the list items in the filter.
    - The next recommendation will be to display how many rows are displayed.
